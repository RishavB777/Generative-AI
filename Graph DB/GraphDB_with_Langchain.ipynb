FC Nürnberg 2–1.[14] Zirkzee made his professional debut in the 3. Liga for Bayern Munich II on 20 July 2019, coming on as a substitute in the 74th minute for Oliver Batista Meier in the away match against Würzburger Kickers.[15]\\n\\nOn 11 December 2019, Zirkzee made his debut for the senior team against Tottenham Hotspur in the final group stage match of the Champions League.[16] He subsequently made his Bundesliga debut on 18 December, coming on as a substitute in the 90th minute in a match against Freiburg tied at 1–1; he scored the winner almost immediately after entering the game. Shortly after, Serge Gnabry added another stoppage-time goal to secure a 3–1 victory.[17] Two days later, he again came off the bench in the final minutes of the game and scored the winning goal as Bayern defeated Wolfsburg.[18] On 13 June 2020, Zirkzee scored the opening goal in Bayern Munich's 2–1 win against Borussia Mönchengladbach.[19] He finished off his debut season with a continental treble.\\nOn 31 January 2021, Zirkzee moved to Italian side Parma on a loan deal.[20] The deal included an option to buy.[20] On 2 April 2021, he suffered an LCL injury,[21] and his loan was limited to four appearances, all as a substitute.\\nOn 3 August 2021, Anderlecht announced the signing of Zirkzee on a season-long loan from Bayern Munich.[22] He finished the 2021–22 season as the club's top scorer with 16 goals, in addition to providing nine assists in 34 league starts.\\nOn 30 August 2022, Zirkzee was transferred to Serie A club Bologna on a permanent deal.[24] Later that year, on 16 October, he scored his first goal at the club, by netting the opener in a 3–2 defeat against Napoli.[25] In his second season under coach Thiago Motta, he managed to score eight goals in 16 games in the first half of the 2023–24 campaign, attracting transfer interest from several top European clubs with his former club Bayern Munich still having a 40% cut of any possible transfer fee.[26] He ultimately finished the season as Bologna's top scorer, netting 11 goals and providing five assists,[27] helping his club secure a berth in the Champions League group stage.\\n\\n\\n\"))]"
